### Files Description.

1. **init**.py:
   It is a blank python script.Because of this special file name, Django treated this folder as
   python package.
   Note: If any folder contains **init**.py file then only that folder is treated as Python
   package.But this rule is applicable until Python 3.3 Version.

2. settings.py:
   In this file we have to specify all our project settings and and configurations like
   installed applications, middileware configurations, database configurations etc

3. urls.py:

- Here we have to store all our url-patterns of our project.
- For every view (web page), we have to define separate url-pattern. End user can use

4. url-patterns to access our webpages.
   wsgi.py:

- wsgi ïƒ  Web Server Gateway Interface.
- We can use this file while deploying our application in production on online server.

5. manage.py:

- The most commonly used python script is manage.py
- It is a command line utility to interact with Django project in various ways like to run
  development server, run tests, create migrations etc.

#### Role of Web Server:

- Web Server provides environment to run our web applications.
- Web Server is responsible to receive the request and forward request to the
  corresponding web component based on url-pattern and to provide response to the
  end user.
- Django framework is responsible to provide development server. Even Django
  framework provides one inbuilt database sqlite. Special Thanks to Django.
  Note: Once we started Server a special database related file will be generated in our
  project folder structure.
  **db.sqlite3**
